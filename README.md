EXP-2-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-
Aim:
Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios

Experiment: Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

Algorithm:
Define Experiment Scope : Clearly outline the purpose and boundaries of the experiment by selecting relevant domains or topics

Prepare Prompts and Outputs : Develop paired prompts for every selected topic—first a broad or unstructured prompt that elicits a general response, and then a refined prompt that requests specific information, explanation, or analysis.

Query AI Model : Submit each prepared prompt to the chosen AI model (such as GPT, Claude, Gemini) separately—first the basic prompts, then the refined ones—to gather a complete set of responses for all scenarios.

Evaluate Responses : Analyze the model’s answers using predefined criteria including quality (clarity and relevance), accuracy (correctness of content), and depth (level of detail, insight, and explanation).

Compare Results : Systematically compare the answers given by the AI to the basic versus the refined prompts for each topic.

Conclude Insights : Draw overall conclusions based on the experiment’s findings, describing the specific benefit of refined prompt engineering on AI output performance.

Topic : Science

Basic prmopt output(generic)

A: Ohm’s Law states that voltage = current × resistance (V = IR).

Refined prompt output

A:Definition: Ohm’s Law relates voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit as V = IR.

Applications:

Designing circuits (calculating resistor values).

Measuring unknown resistance.

Protecting devices from overcurrent.

Limitations: Does not apply to non-linear components like diodes and transistors.

**Topic : Environmental changes **

Basic prompt output(generic)

A: Global warming is the rise in Earth’s average temperature due to greenhouse gases.

Refined prompt output

A:Definition: Global warming is the long-term increase in Earth’s temperature due to the greenhouse effect.

Causes: Burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial emissions.

Effects: Melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather, biodiversity loss.

Solutions: Renewable energy adoption, afforestation, energy efficiency, international climate agreements.

Topic : General Knowledge

Basic prompt output(generic)

A: Valentina Tereshkova from the Soviet Union in 1963.

Refined prompt output

A:Name: Valentina Tereshkova.

Country: Soviet Union (USSR).

Year & Mission: 1963, Vostok 6 mission.

Significance: First and youngest woman in space, spent ~3 days orbiting Earth. Pioneered women’s participation in space exploration.
